### Hi there 👋

I am an aspiring Machine learning Engineer and Data scientist with a PhD in Chemical Engineering. I am seeking opportunities and partnership in data analytics, developing and implementing machine learning models. I am interested in projects that can lead to quantifiable commercial impact whilst providing a great learning experience.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on machine learning models using TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn for classification and regression.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, LSTM, GAN, RL) for Computer Vision, and image analytics
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advancing my skills on Computer vision, image and video analytics.
- 💬 Ask me about colloidal dynamics and the electro-kinetic  models for their interpretations, and rheology of advanced materials used in biomedicine.
